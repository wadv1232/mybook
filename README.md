# Learning machine learning

## 什么是学习？

> **学习**[是透过外界教授或从自身经验提高能力的过程。](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/学习)

## 通过什么学习？学习的途径？

### 书本

通过书籍获取知识

读书的过程就是讲一本厚书读薄，然后再讲薄书读厚的过程。过程类似与**AutoEncode**，先进行信息压缩，再进行信息还原。整个过程就是learning的过程。

### 实践

## 什么是机器学习？

[Machine learning \(ML\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## 机器学习分类

At the most fundamental level, machine learning can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

_Supervised learning_involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data. This is further subdivided into_classification_tasks and_regression_tasks: in classification, the labels are discrete categories, while in regression, the labels are continuous quantities. We will see examples of both types of supervised learning in the following section.

_Unsupervised learning_involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label, and is often described as "letting the dataset speak for itself." These models include tasks such as_clustering_and_dimensionality reduction._Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.
